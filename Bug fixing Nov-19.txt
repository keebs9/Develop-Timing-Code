If all the units are set the same in the profile, how can you choose units?

Places to change program:
1) When displaying the choices for calibration units
2) When loading the data, load into profiles but not the buttons
3) When it is referenced to draw scales and live pressure etc.
4) Possibly! When saving the profile after calibration

Possible code:
// store the available units in each of the buttons (will be restored to current profiles later)
  for (byte i=0; i<4; i++){ // repeat for each of 4 possible unit names
    bText[i] = units[i];
  }

Where "units[]" used:
Set to the value of bText in Button_Setup {units[aC] = bText[nButtons];}
Used as display text in unit selection during calibration {"in " + units[nConfigs-1]}
Set to value of bText after cal data loaded {units[i] = bText[i+nButtons];}
Used as text for live pressure in Plot_Trace tab {livePressure = units[aC];}
Used as text for the scales in Scales tab {text(nVal + " " + units[aC]}
Set to value of bText in Selections tab when in cal mode {units[nConfigs-1] = bText[j];}

Where "bText[]" used:
Defined in Button setup as default values i.e., cmH2O, mBar, mmHg, PSI
Used as text to list data sets during load & save operations (existing data not default units)
Used in drawButtons routine in ScreenSetup tab
Used to set units[4] text during calibration

In summary:
units[] are used routinely for display purposes so should represent the actual units which could all be the same. During calibration, the 4 standard button texts are required when choosing the untis.

Moved setting of units[aC] (meaining active profile) to end of loadCalData function.

Load / Save / Cal working ok units wise

**********Channel problem**********
ADC stores the cahnnel number and should be 0 for low range or 1 for high range
When acquiring pressure the value is set to dataInt[ADC[aC]]
Fixed acquiring data from wrong pressure channel

If you load a high range dataset then change the scale and save over a low range dataset, then the range incorrectly changes to the low range. FIXED!!!!!!! Just added a line to copy the channel number across. This was absent as the channel number was a late addition to the program.
