# Develop-Timing-Code
This is the repository for my development of a "Processing" sketch, with the onjectives of: 
  acquiring pressure data from an Arduino
  displaying a live plot of the data on a chart window featuring scales, within a GUI
  timing pressure cycles by analysing the data in comparison to user-defined pressure-windows
  displaying last/current and average timing cycles
