# Develop-Timing-Code
This is the repository for my development of a "Processing" sketch, with the onjectives of: 
1) acquiring pressure data from an Arduino
2) displaying a live plot of the data on a chart window featuring scales, within a GUI
3) timing pressure cycles by analysing the data in comparison to user-defined pressure-windows
4) displaying last/current and average timing cycles
